# Welcome to GC Design System

GC Design System pairs code with designs and guidance based on federal standards and accessibility best practice. Reusable components and styles help you to build forms, websites, and applications.

This is a design system for the Canadian Digital Service built by a small team of public servants. We believe modern, efficient design and development can improve the quality of people's experiences with government services. We hope to raise the bar for consistent, inclusive user interfaces across digital products.

GC Design System works in the environment you want to work in. You'll get the same patterns and styles across products and browsers without having to code from scratch or redefine values. It works independently of GC Web and the Web Experience Toolkit (WET).
