          - **examples of designs**: screenshots, prototypes, links to live services
          - **research findings**: tell or show us your discovery, your use case, or how your relevant prototype or service has been tested with people using the service
          - **code**: prototype code or production code; share your implementations of the relevant component or pattern in services
